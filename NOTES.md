users
users have a schedule on profile page. Calendar?? Maybe that's too complex. But should be able to add to schedule and list on profile. Persist data...favorite an instructor, add anonymous review for instructor
Instructor page will show number of favorites from previous students. (more friendly, anonymous, less awkward version of reviewing)
Users maintain an array of favorited instructors.
List all instructors?


To Do List:
-sort dance classes chronologically
-can delete classes from your schedule
-alert if user tries to add class that conflicts with schedule
-refactor fetch actions into separate components/reducers

***Intructor component is broken. Why???***
